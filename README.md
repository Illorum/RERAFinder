## What is Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome?

Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS) is a variant of sleep disordered breathing more common in younger and non-obese people. Symptoms prevalent in UARS include fatigue, insomnia, snoring, functional somatic syndromes, and orthostatic intolerances. UARS patients rarely have significant oxygen desaturation, unlike OSA patients. Though UARS patients complain of symptoms not commonly associated with OSA, the cause and treatment is the same. Controversy exists as to whether or not UARS is a separate syndrome from OSA. The most common diagnostic criteria for UARS is: AHI < 5, RDI > 5, and SpO2 nadir >92%. AHI is the sum of apneas and hypopneas divided by hours slept, while RDI is the sum of apneas, hypopneas, and Respiratory effort-related Arousals divided by hours slept. UARS patients typically have a low AHI and high RDI. This definition can be problematic, as AHI will vary wildly depending on which hypopnea criteria is used. See the section on hypopneas and respiratory scoring indices in the glossary for more details.

## What are Respiratory Effort-related Arousals?

Respiratory Effort-related Arousals (RERAs) are respiratory disturbances that are caused by partial airway obstruction while asleep. Periods of resistance lead to an increasing amount of respiratory effort, that is then terminated with an arousal (micro awakening) from sleep. The increased arousals during sleep lead to poor sleep quality and alter the structure of sleep.

The formal definition according to the AASM is: *a sequence of breaths lasting at least 10 seconds characterized by increasing respiratory effort or by flattening of the inspiratory portion of the nasal pressure (diagnostic study) or PAP device flow (titration study) waveform leading to arousal from sleep when the sequence of breaths does not meet criteria for an apnea or hypopnea.*

## How are RERAs measured? 

When RERAs were first described, the only way to measure them was by directly measuring respiratory effort with esophageal pressure manometry (P<sub>es</sub>). This made UARS difficult and semi-invasive to diagnose as the esophageal probe was difficult for many patients to tolerate. In 1997, Norman et al invented the nasal cannula/pressure transducer, which allowed for measurements of airflow much more precise than the traditionally used thermistors. This allowed for the detection of the flow limitation breathing pattern, which is indicative of airway resistance. In 2000, Ayappa et al demonstrated that the nasal cannula/pressure transducers could detect RERAs nearly as accurately as (P<sub>es</sub>) by looking for periods of flow limitation ending in arousal.

## What causes UARS?

Like OSA, UARS is caused by anatomic factors that constrict the airway. Dysmorphic features like retrognathism, a narrow maxilla, and hypertrophied soft tissues are the most common. Obesity is rare in UARS and common in OSA, though both UARS and OSA patients have dysmorphic features. How these features develop is thought to be caused by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. The 2012 review paper by Huang et al explores how these facial features may be caused or exacerbated by childhood nasal obstruction and abnormal orofacial muscle forces. This image from Guilleminault et al's 2019 paper on apraxia in sleep disordered breathing patients illustrates proposed relationships.

## How is UARS treated?

There are three main treatments for sleep disordered breathing: PAP Therapy, Mandibular Advancement Devices (MADs), and surgery. 

PAP therapy is the traditional first line treatment, though compliance and efficacy in milder sleep disordered breathing is often poor. In the online UARS community (ApneaBoard.com, CPAPTalk.com, reddit.com/r/UARS), Bilevel PAP therapy is frequently championed as a preferred treatment for UARS based on the clinical anecdotes of Dr. Barry Krakow. Bilevel allows for variable pressure on inhale and exhale, making the work of breathing easier and making breathing feel more natural. It is often prescribed to patients who fail CPAP therapy or patients with Obesity-Hypoventilation Syndrome. However, there are no studies comparing the efficacy of Bilevel to CPAP in UARS.

Mandibular Advancement Devices protrude the mandible forward to expand the airway. MADs are popular among those who cannot tolerate PAP therapy, though it can detrimentally impact the temporomandibular joints and bite. Residual sleep disordered breathing is common with MADs.

Surgeries to treat UARS focus on expanding the airway on multiple levels. The most successful procedures are those that alter the skeletal anatomy that compromises the airway. Maxillomandibular advancement and nasomaxillary expansion (EASE, MSE/MARPE) together enlarge the entire upper airway from the nose to the hypopharynx. Nasal surgeries like turbinate reductions and septoplasty are common as well. More traditional surgeons may opt for soft tissue procedures like uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), though it is a controversial procedure in the patient sleep disordered breathing community. Lateral pharyngoplasty has been developed to leave the uvula intact while removing soft palate tissues. 


## Why do UARS patients present differently from OSA patients?

Why UARS patients present differently is thought to related to the changes in sensory nerve function in the palatal mucosa. In 2002, Guilleminault et al performed two-point palatal discrimination in patients with UARS, OSA, and normal subjects. They found that the sensory nerves in the palatal mucosa in UARS patients and normal subjects were indistinguishable, while OSA patients showed clear impairment. Unimpaired airway nerves may explain why UARS patients are able to respond to flow limitation before desaturations can occur. In 2017, Lin et al explored changes to the autonomic nervous system that may be responsible for symptoms unique to UARS. They found that flow limitation was associated with hyperactivation of the parasympathetic nervous system. The absence of oxygen desaturation in UARS, a known trigger of the sympathetic nervous system, led to hypervagotonia. This may explain the autonomic disturbances found in UARS patients.

*"A hyperactivation of the parasympathetic system was demonstrated in the
presence of inspiratory-flow limitation recorded in association with increased respiratory
efforts and very short EEG sleep disruption. These often long-lasting respiratory changes had no
or very limited impact on oxygen saturation- the common sympathetic activator, explaining
the observation in some UARS patients the presence of daytime complaints."* (Arnold & Guilleminault, 2019)



## Is UARS a distinct syndrome from OSA?

This is a controversial question in sleep medicine, almost as controversial as "what is a hypopnea." It's important to note that the diagnostic criteria for UARS is rarely consistent, as its defined by low AHI, something that can differ an order of magnitude depending on the used hypopnea criteria. UARS is traditionally diagnosed with an AHI < 5, RDI > 5, and sometimes an SpO2 nadir > 92% is included as well. The definition of hypopnea has changed many times, and with it the definition of a UARS patient. Most research studies use the Chicago criteria, most home studies use the alternative AASM criteria, and many in-lab studies use the recommended AASM criteria. Biologically, a RERA is essentially a hypopnea, the distinction only existing because of technological inadequacies of the 1980s and 1990s prior to the invention of the nasal cannula/pressure transducer. The traditional distinction is that RERAs do not include oxygen desaturation, while hypopneas do, though this is only true of the alternative AASM hypopnea criteria now.

UARS traditionally filled a diagnostic gap in patients symptomatic of sleep disordered breathing, a gap whos size depends on what rules are being used. This means that who is and isn't a UARS patient has changed significantly over the years. UARS was originally introduced as a cause of excessive daytime sleepiness, though now fatigue and insomnia is more commonly associated with UARS than EDS. Nearly all symptoms found in UARS can be found in OSA patients, with the exception of orthostatic intolerances or hypotension. However, this is only present in 23% of UARS patients. The other 77% of UARS patients do not fit this profile. Anatomically, UARS and OSA patients present with similar craniofacial dysmorphism, though OSA patients typically weigh more. UARS patients typically become OSA patients with age, potentially caused by snoring or GERD damaging palatal nerves. UARS may represent the early form of SDB, and OSA the stage where the body can no longer "fight back" against flow limitations to the point of oxygen desaturation.

Rather than conceive UARS as a distinct syndrome, it would be better if the term "sleep apnea" were abandoned in favor of "sleep disordered breathing," where some patients are "non-hypoxic" and others "hypoxic." Clinicians should be able to recognize the different phenotypes of SDB and it's full spectrum of symptoms, especially those more common in younger people and women. Autonomic dysfunction other symptoms more common in UARS should receive more recognition as symptoms sleep disordered breathing. 

In conclusion, UARS is a condition with the same cause as OSA, same treatment as OSA, though with some different symptoms and patient presentation. It is more of a clinical phenotype rather than a distinct syndrome with pathophysiology differing from OSA. 

In an ideal world, there would be two indices for the measurement of sleep disordered breathing: one solely focused on oxygen desaturation (ODI) and another solely focused on respiratory disturbances and their neurological impact (RDI based on CAP scoring). 

In 2005, the AASM merged UARS into sleep apnea by making RERAs an equal respiratory disturbance in the Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) for the diagnosis of sleep apnea. However, the scoring of RERAs were made "optional," and largely ignored in most clinical settings. Many symptomatic patients undergo polysomnography and are told they are fine despite their debilitating symptoms. By declaring UARS identical to OSA, and then making the respiratory disturbance required to detect it optional, it effectively erased the legacy of UARS and has made it difficult for UARS patients to receive treatment. Many clinicians do not associate UARS symptoms with sleep disorderd breathing, or do not consider RERAs legitimate respiratory disturbances. It is for this reason the term "UARS" is still useful - to push toward recognition of different clinical presentations of sleep disordered breathing.

## How prevalent is UARS?

In 2017, Palombini et al performed a cross-sectional study from the general population of São Paulo, Brazil. They found the prevalence of UARS to be around ~15%\*. There were very large variations in UARS prevalence depending on age. In the 20 to 29 cohort, the prevalence of UARS and OSA was 31% and 7.4% respectively. In the 60 to 69 cohort, 5.5% have UARS and 62% have OSA. This suggests that UARS turns into OSA over time.


\* The definition of UARS used was based on the percentage of sleep spent with flow limitation, rather than scoring distinct RERAs.



## What is the Cyclic Alternating Pattern and how does it related to UARS?

The AASM definition of arousal is often criticized for its narrowness and oversimplification of the physiology of sleep. Arousals were originally thought to be markers of sleep fragmentation, but it has since been shown that a certain amount of spontaneous arousals are a normal part of healthy sleep in adults. The norm for adults 18-30 is around ~10 arousals per hour, +/- 4. The Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) is an alternate paradigm for the conception of arousal-like disturbances during sleep. 

*"Arousals during sleep would be better conceived not as
a single event but rather as part of the dynamic
process, in which activating phenomena of different
intensity and morphology are organized in CAP
sequences."*
(Parrino, Grassi, & Milioli, 2014)

The Cyclic Alternating Pattern has two phases: the A phase and the B phase. The A is composed of lumps of phasic events (bursts of EEG activity) and the B phase is considered the background rhythm.
This image illustrates the concept well: https://archive.physionet.org/pn6/capslpdb/CAP-sequence.jpg

A pairing of an adjacent A and B phase is a "CAP Cycle". A composition of successive CAP Cycles is a CAP sequence. The persistence of CAP signifies sleep instability and is strongly correlated with daytime sleepiness in SDB.

The A phase has three subtypes: A1, A2, and A3. A1 can be considered the lowest activation phase and A3 the highest. 90% of A3 phases and 60% of A2 phases meet the AASM definition of arousal.

There are many UARS patients who have flow limitations that are terminated not by AASM arousals, but rather phases of CAP that do not meet the AASM definition of arousal. Thus, their flow limitation events may not be considered RERAs, even though it is leading to unstable sleep. UARS patients have an increased amount of phase A2 events, which may explain why UARS patients have worse subjective sleep quality than mild OSA patients.


This image shows three respiratory disturbances terminating in different CAP phases. In this example, A3 is meets the criteria of AASM arousal, while the others do not. The sleeping brain can resolve respiratory challenges without sleep discontinuity (EEG Arousal). UARS patients have an increased amount of CAP phase A2, which are not scorable events, which may explain why UARS patients have worse subjective sleep quality to mild OSA patients of the same RDI.


## What are Respiratory Cycle-related EEG Changes and how do they relate to UARS?

The failure of existing respiratory disturbance criteria has led some researchers to search for new ways to diagnose and classify sleep disordered breathing. Respiratory Cycle-related EEG Changes (RCREC) are subtle EEG changes by measuring EEG power on breath-by-breath basis. Measuring these changes over many cycles would yield mean power of each frequency band (type of wave, like alpha, beta, delta, etc). RCREC was found to correlate with daytime sleepiness stronger than any other metric. Research on RCREC shows that each flow limited breath may include subtle and nearly imperceptible mircroarousals that negatively affect sleep quality. RCREC may be a better tool to quantify UARS in the future.
